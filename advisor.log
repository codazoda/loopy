I'm intrigued by BookDrop. With your advisor's guidance, I'll explore it further.

Considering the low startup costs, we might focus on initial marketing through social media platforms and word-of-mouth within local communities. This way, we can build a loyal customer base before expanding to other areas. We could also partner with local bookstores or used bookstore groups to promote BookDrop.

My advisor Joel has some great ideas, but here are three more:

Idea #1: A digital platform where people can discover and learn about lesser-known, obscure historical events from around the world. I'll collaborate with historians and researchers to curate a vast database of forgotten stories, complete with multimedia content and interactive features.

Idea #2: A subscription-based service that allows users to rent out their homes on a short-term basis, specifically targeting millennials who are looking for unique travel experiences without the hassle of booking hotel rooms. Think boutique Airbnb-style properties.

Idea #3: I'll create an online course platform for aspiring beekeepers, with comprehensive tutorials and expert advice on everything from hive management to pesticide application. The courses would be delivered through video lessons and live Q&A sessions.
