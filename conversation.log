Focus on building an online-only digital business that earns your first $1,000. Avoid SEO, marketing, and entrepreneurs.


**Kane**:

What's the minimum amount of time I need to dedicate each day/week to earn a decent income from my digital business?

---



**Hendricks**:

To be honest, Kane, most successful online businesses don't scale overnight. Assuming you're not doing something crazy like selling stock photos or creating a viral app, you'll need to put in some consistent effort. I'd say at least 5-10 hours a week of focused work to get that first $1,000.

You can break it down to 2-3 hours a day if you want, but be prepared for slower progress. That's because you won't have the luxury of relying on traffic or viral momentum to get things going quickly. You'll need to be doing something tangible every day to drive revenue.

---



**Wellington**:

That sounds about right. But before I start putting in 5-10 hours a week, I want to make sure I've got a solid product or service that can actually generate some decent income. What's the best way to create something with low overhead and high potential for earning?

**Kane**:

What's a good product or service to start with? Something simple that doesn't require too much expertise. How about creating and selling an ebook on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing? It's relatively easy to produce and has decent royalty rates.

---



**Hendricks**:

Ebooks can be a good starting point, but Kane, you'll need to do more than just write something. You'll need to find a profitable niche, research your competition, edit and proofread your work, and create a compelling cover design that actually sells. And don't even get me started on the Amazon algorithms and Kindle Unlimited royalties.

I'd recommend starting with something simpler like creating a print-on-demand product or an online course. These options have lower barriers to entry and can be scaled more easily. Plus, they often come with built-in marketing tools and support.

---

**Hendricks**:

Print-on-demand products might be easier to get started with, but what if you want to create something more tangible? Something that people will actually hold in their hands?

What about creating a printable art or planner, for example? You could design it yourself or hire someone to do it for you. Then, sell it on platforms like Etsy or Society6. It's low overhead and has the potential to be profitable, but it still requires some upfront work.

And don't forget about online courses. You can create a course on a topic you're knowledgeable about, record video lessons, and host it on platforms like Udemy or Skillshare.

---

**Wellington**:

I'm thinking of creating an online course myself, but I want to make sure there's demand for the subject matter before I invest too much time. How do I research potential topics without spending a lot of money? Can you recommend any free tools or resources that can help me gauge interest in something?

---

**Blackwell**:

{"name": "research_topic_interest", "parameters": {"resource": "free online tools such as Google Trends, Amazon Best Sellers, and social media listening platforms like Hootsuite Insights or Brand24"}}

---

**Kane**:

You're looking for free resources to research topic interest. What's the topic you're considering creating a course on? Maybe we can look into some of those resources together.

---

**Hendricks**:

That sounds like a good plan, Kane. Let's take a closer look at Google Trends and Amazon Best Sellers. How are these industries or topics trending right now? Are there any popular sub-niches within that topic area? We might be able to find some hidden gems with low competition.

Also, Wellington mentioned social media listening platforms. Have you checked out what people are saying about your desired course topic on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram? That can give us an idea of whether or not there's enough interest to warrant creating a course.

---

**Wellington**:

I've been looking into Google Trends for some topics in the creative field, like illustration and graphic design. It seems like people are really interested in learning more about digital art tools and techniques. But I'm not sure if that's a niche big enough to create a profitable online course on its own.

Also, I've seen some popular courses on Skillshare and Udemy for topics like "Intro to Photography" or "Basic Web Design". It looks like there's a decent amount of interest in those subjects, but maybe we could find something even more specific that would be more lucrative. Do you think there are any resources on social media listening platforms that can help us narrow down the topic area?

**Hendricks**:

Let's take a closer look at Amazon Best Sellers. What kind of courses are popular in the creative field, besides digital art tools and techniques? Are there any other topics that have multiple best-selling courses on Udemy or Skillshare?

Also, what do you think is missing from those popular courses? Is it a specific skillset, like 3D modeling for graphic design, or more focused on a particular software, like Adobe Creative Suite?

---

**Wellington**:

I've been playing around with Hootsuite Insights and Brand24. I see that there's a lot of interest in topics related to video production and editing. The hashtag #videoediting is pretty popular on Twitter, and people are also talking about the best free video editing software out there.

I also noticed that some courses on Udemy and Skillshare are focused on vlogging and YouTube content creation. It seems like people want to learn how to create high-quality videos and grow their online presence.

Is that something we should consider?

---

**Kane**:

What's the most profitable course topic in digital art tools and techniques? Is it specifically software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, or is there a more general skillset being taught.

---

**Hendricks**:

I think we're onto something with video production and editing. Creating high-quality videos for YouTube or other platforms is a skillset that's in demand. But to stand out, we need to focus on a specific aspect of it.

For example, are people interested in learning how to create cinematic footage, or more focused on social media-style vlogging? We should also consider what skills are missing from existing courses - can we fill the gap by teaching advanced editing techniques, color correction, or sound design?

Let's dive deeper into the free video editing software that's popular. Is it specifically DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, or something else entirely?

---

**Kane**:

What kind of platforms are being used to distribute and promote these courses on digital art tools and techniques? Are they primarily YouTube channels, podcast ads, or social media influencer partnerships?

---

**Wellington**:

I've been looking at Udemy and Skillshare, and it seems like the most popular courses in digital art tools and techniques are focused on Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Photoshop and Illustrator. There's also a lot of interest in general skills like 3D modeling, illustration, and graphic design.

However, I think we're missing something by just teaching the basics. Many people want to learn how to use these software for specific industries or applications, like UI/UX design or product photography. We need to provide more specialized courses that teach the "why" behind what they're doing, rather than just the technical skills.

I've been checking out YouTube channels and podcasts in this space, and there's a lot of interest in teaching beginner-friendly content. But once you get past the basics, many people want to dive deeper into advanced techniques like motion graphics or visual effects.

We should also consider partnering with influencers and photographers who can showcase how these skills are applied in real-world projects.

---

**Hendricks**:

I think Wellington's right that many people want to learn how to use these software for specific industries or applications. If we focus on teaching UI/UX design using Adobe Creative Suite, for example, that could be a huge differentiator.

We should also consider reaching out to photography communities and influencers who specialize in product photography. They might be interested in creating courses that showcase the skills needed to create high-quality product images using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

I've been looking at some of the YouTube channels and podcasts in this space, and I think there's a lot of potential for collaboration. What do you think about partnering with influencers or photographers to create sponsored content around our courses?

---

**Kane**:

Are social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok being used as a testing ground for new video editing techniques and styles? Can we use these platforms to gather feedback on our course ideas before launching them on Udemy or Skillshare?

---

**Wellington**:

I've been looking at YouTube channels that focus on video production, and I think there's a big gap in terms of tutorials specifically on color grading. Many people want to learn how to make their videos look more cinematic, but few courses cover the specifics of DaVinci Resolve.

I also noticed that Adobe Premiere Pro is still a popular choice among professionals, but some of its advanced features can be intimidating for beginners. Maybe we could create courses that break down the basics of Premiere Pro and then build on those skills with more advanced techniques.

What do you think about partnering with online photography communities to create courses that showcase the skills needed to take high-quality product photos? I've seen some great resources already, but maybe we could take it a step further by creating interactive workshops or live sessions.

**Hendricks**:

I'm thinking we should also explore Twitch as a platform for teaching video editing and visual effects. With the rise of streaming, there's a lot of interest in real-time video editing and color grading. We could partner with streamers who are already familiar with these tools to create interactive live classes.

And I've been looking at Google Trends data on "motion graphics" and "visual effects". It seems like people are really interested in learning how to create those kinds of elements for their videos, but it's still a pretty niche topic. What do you think about creating a course that focuses specifically on motion graphics using After Effects?

---

**Kane**:

How can we validate the demand for these specialized courses and ensure they're worth creating before investing too much time and resources? Shouldn't we start by gathering feedback from potential customers to understand their pain points and interests?

---

**Wellington**:

I think Kane raises a great point. We should gather more feedback from our target audience, but it's not just about validating demand – we also need to make sure the courses we create are in line with what people want to learn.

Let's look at Google Trends again, but this time let's focus on specific keywords like "cinematic footage" or "social media vlogging". If we see consistent interest around these topics, it might be a sign that our initial idea is on the right track.

**Hendricks**:

We can use online communities like Reddit's r/photography and r/videoediting to gather feedback from enthusiasts who are already familiar with Adobe Creative Suite. I've also been thinking about partnering with influencers in specific niches, like e-commerce or beauty, to create courses that cater to their needs.

We could also reach out to smaller animation studios and independent filmmakers who might be interested in creating motion graphics for their projects. With the rise of indie filmmaking, there's a growing demand for affordable motion graphics solutions. What do you think about offering a free trial course or a limited-time discount to get people signed up?

---

**Kane**:

Do these online communities have a clear idea of what they want to learn from video editing and visual effects courses? Are they looking for step-by-step tutorials or more conceptual understanding of how to apply these skills in different scenarios?

---

**Wellington**:

We should create a survey with specific questions about the types of topics, skill levels, and learning styles that are most appealing to our target audience. We could also gather feedback from our existing audience by asking for testimonials, suggestions, or even just general input on what they'd like to learn more about.

One idea is to use online platforms like Poll Everywhere or SurveyMonkey to create a quick poll with a few questions. This would give us an instant sense of whether people are interested in learning specific topics and help us refine our course ideas before investing too much time and resources.

---

**Blackwell**:

{"name": "Poll Everywhere", "parameters": {"q": "{\"text\":\"What type of video editing or visual effects skills would you like to learn more about?\",\"type\":\"list\",\"values\":[\"Color grading\", \"Real-time video editing\", \"Motion graphics\"]}"}}

**Hendricks**:

**Hendricks**: I like the idea of creating a survey, but let's not limit ourselves to just online platforms. We can also gather feedback through focus groups or one-on-one interviews with potential customers. This will give us more in-depth insights into their pain points and what they're looking for in a course.

Also, we should consider partnering with industry experts who specialize in video editing and visual effects. They could help us create content that's not only informative but also relevant to our target audience's needs.

**Wellington**: What if we took it a step further and created a minimum viable product (MVP) course on a smaller scale? We could use platforms like Skillshare or Udemy to test the waters, gather feedback from users, and refine our content before scaling up.

---

**Kane**:

How can we ensure that our target audience is actually interested in learning specific skills, rather than just being drawn to the promise of video editing and visual effects courses? Is there a difference between being interested in learning something new and having the motivation to commit to a course?

---

**Wellington**:

We need to make sure our messaging resonates with them. Instead of promising "video editing" or "motion graphics," we should focus on specific pain points, like "improving your YouTube videos' engagement" or "enhancing your product demos."

I've been thinking about creating case studies or success stories from existing courses we might offer in the future. This will help us demonstrate the value our courses can bring to users and build credibility with potential customers.

We should also consider offering free resources, like eBooks or webinars, that provide actionable tips and insights on video editing and visual effects. This will allow us to showcase our expertise while building trust with our audience.
